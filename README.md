# GhostHunt
GhostHunt is an AR game where you defend yourself from ghosts.

In GhostHunt, ghosts try to haunt you. You need to search the room around you for paranormal presence. 

Use the EMF device to detect ghosts, capture them by taking a picture of them and send them away with your spirit box.

Be quick or you'll be forever haunted!
